Description
===========

This isn't actually working yet. It is close, but there are weird isues in weird places. 

This cookbook is to install and configure dovecot. It will be using all of the default options. I will have the variables for other systems, but I will be focusing on Debian. This has NOT been tested on RedHat/CentOS/Suse/etc.
I'd imagine Ubuntu would work, but use at your own risk.

Requirements
============

Platform:

* Debian

Attributes
==========
 Default attributes for dovecot configuration. 
 See http://wiki.dovecot.org/QuickConfiguration for help.

 Coming soon!*
 


Examples

 *Note: Probably not actually coming soon, because I'm kinda lazy at times. Oh well. If you don't like it, make a change request!
